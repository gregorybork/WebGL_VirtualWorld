# WebGL_VirtualWorld
I make a virtual world that the user can roam freely. The objective of this project was to make my own version of the video game Minecraft. I used my lessons from a computer graphics course to make a virtual block world like the trending video game. Note: I use WebGL, not any other higher level frameworks, such as three.js.

The user navigates the world with the mouse to change perspective and keyboard keys to move the camera.<br> <br>
Camera movement: <br>
W moves the player up <br>
S moves the player down <br>
A moves the player left <br>
D moves the player right <br><br>
The world fits inside a cube which make the walls/ceiling, the ground is made from a single cube, and the structure in the middle are made from mutiple cubes. There are many structures similar to the image scattered throughout the world. <br><br> I add a blue texture that covers all the cubes that make up the virtual world.
